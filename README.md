# Pardon our dust!
We are just moving out of prototyping and into the initial development of this
project.  Hexflex is not ready for any type of show-time yet, but with your
help, we might get there sooner!

# Hexflex

Hexflex is a Ruby gem and command-line tool for automatically generating
[hexaflexagons].

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'hexaflexa'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install hexaflexa

## Usage

Run with `./bin/flex`.  *Note that this doesn't do a whole lot right now, but
more is coming soon!*

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits
and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
